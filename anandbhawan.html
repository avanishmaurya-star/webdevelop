Freedom Struggle Hub – The mansion hosted many key meetings of the Indian National Congress and was a gathering place for leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, and Subhas Chandra Bose.

Converted into a Museum – Now a museum, it showcases personal belongings, books, photographs, and historical documents related to the Nehru-Gandhi family and India's independence.

Indira Gandhi's Birthplace – Indira Gandhi, India's first woman Prime Minister, spent a significant part of her childhood here.
